/**
\page VALIDATIONSCRIPTS_ Validation scripts 

The file cmsWR/scripts/wrValidation.sh processes all minitrees whose versions correspond to the version
listed in configs/2015-v1.conf using 
 - bin/analysis.cpp
 - test/miniTreeDumpCheck.py
 - several plotting macros in test/.  To use this script:

-# excute voms-proxy-init --voms cms to make a GRID certificate proxy (by default minitrees are accessed through xrootd)
-# execute 
\verbatim
./scripts/wrValidation.sh >& runningWrValidation.txt &
\endverbatim   
   to start the validation script, run it in the background, and pipe any text sent to stdout by
   wrValidation.sh to a txt file.

when the script is finished the directory cmsWR/test/validationPlots/ will be filled with plots. Scale factors to bring DY MC MLL
into agreement with data MLL in the dytagandprobe region, the number of events in dytagandprobe events in the Z peak region in
data and MC, and the number of events in all minitrees (not only the ones processed by analysis.cpp) will be written into
files in data/2015-v1/.
