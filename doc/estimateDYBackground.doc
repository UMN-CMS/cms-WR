/**
\page _DYBKGND Estimate of the DY+Jets background using MC and collision data
First the DY MC must be normalized to data in the dilepton mass distribution.  The DYtagandprobe
sideband is used for this, and the scale factors are calculated automatically when the minitree
validation script is run.  If the MC or collision data being analyzed was not collected in 2015 using
74X, then the scale factors to correct for efficiency diffierences in the HEEP ID, electron trigger,
and electron reco must be recomputed and updated in analysis.cpp.  Follow the instructions on the Tag
and Probe tool twiki to estimate these SFs.  The inclusive (constant versus electron ET) SFs obtained
from makeTree.py should be sufficient, but fitter.py should also be run to check the validity of each
SF as a function of electron ET.  These SFs should only be applied to dytagandprobe events, as is
currently setup in analysis.cpp.

Once the HLT, HEEP ID, and reco efficiency SFs have been updated, follow the instructions in \ref VALIDATIONSCRIPTS_
to run the minitree validation script, and save the dilepton mass based DY MC scale factors.

One the scale factors are calculated, process the optimal DY MC sample using analysis.cpp with
signal region requirements and the MLL scale factors applied.  In 2015, the optimal DY MC sample
was the amcnlo inclusive DYJetsToLL sample, and this sample is processed by analysis.cpp by executing:

\verbatim
cd cmsWR/
voms-proxy-init --voms cms
make
./bin/analysis -c MuMu -m DYAMC --ignoreDyScaleFactors false >& dyAmcMuMuSignalRegion.txt &
./bin/analysis -c EE -m DYAMC --ignoreDyScaleFactors false >& dyAmcEESignalRegion.txt &
\endverbatim

The two resulting .root files will have the four object mass distribution saved in a TTree named
Tree_Iter0, in a branch named WR_mass.  The distribution of all WR_mass values is the DYJets
background estimate.
