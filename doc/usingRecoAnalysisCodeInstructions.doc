Instructions for using the reco analysis code to investigate kinematic distributions made from reco objects matched to GEN quarks
and leptons in WR->LLJJ events.  This code was first developed for studying WR->eejj events, but is equally applicable to
WR->mumu jj events.

1. Within the cmsWR/ directory, make a directory named plots.  Within this 'plots' directory, make a directory named GEN and
   another directory named RECO.

2. Move into the 'GEN' directory, and make five new directories with these names:
matched_noCuts
matched_ptEtaCuts
matched_ptEtaDileptonMassCuts
matched_ptEtaDileptonMassDrCuts
matched_ptEtaDileptonMassDrFourObjMassCuts

3. Move up one directory and into the 'RECO' directory.  Make ten new directories with these names:
matched_noCuts
matched_noCuts_dR_genJetsToGenQuarks
matched_noCuts_dR_recoElesToGenLeadingEles
matched_noCuts_dR_recoElesToGenSubleadingEles
matched_noCuts_dR_recoJetsToGenJets
matched_ptEtaCuts
matched_ptEtaDileptonMassCuts
matched_ptEtaDileptonMassDrCuts
matched_ptEtaDileptonMassDrFourObjMassCuts
matchingEfficiencyVsPtEtaPhi

4. Move up two directories and go into the directory named python.

5. There are two files in the 'python' directory which identify the collections of gen and reco objects
   which should be used by the analysis code.  The two files are named genElectronChannelModules_cff.py, and
   recoElectronChannelModules_cff.py.  If you want to run the analysis code on electron channel events, nothing needs to
   change in either file.  To run the analysis code on muon channel events one InputTag and a few pdgId values need to be
   changed in these two files.  To run on muon channel events:
   1. open genElectronChannelModules_cff.py and change all instances of 9900012 to 9900014, and all instances of
     11 to 12 (electron pdgId-->muon pdgId).
   2. open recoElectronChannelModules_cff.py and change the one instance of "slimmedElectrons" to a muon collection InputTag.

6. In the 'python' directory, open the file named recoElectronChannel_cfg.py.  Change the file name listed in the TFileService module to
   a sensible name.  In the cms.Source module, input the absolute path names to the miniAOD root files which need to be analyzed.

7. Go up one directory and run the reco analysis code by executing:
   cmsRun python/recoElectronChannel_cfg.py

8. Go into the macros directory.  Within 'macros', open the file named dumpTreePlots.C. There are many absolute file path
   names listed in this file, both for .root files output by recoElectronChannel_cfg.py and path names to directories within the 'plots'
   directory.  These path names need to be updated so that they point to existing root files and directories.  Once these path names are
   updated you can run dumpTreePlots.C as a macro, and generate plots using reco objects matched to GEN objects after different levels of
   reco cuts (pt and eta, dilepton mass, etc).
