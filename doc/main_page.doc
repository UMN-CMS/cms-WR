\section _CONF Files Governing Analysis Workflow Configuration
All configuration files and parameters which are used to process minitrees are stored in configs/ and data/.

\par Main configuration file
The file is \b configs/2015-v1.conf lists the json file, minitree and skim version number, the blinded or unblinded
status of minitrees made from collision data, and the location of the .dat file which lists all collision
data and MC samples from which minitrees have been made.

The following information is also stored in configs/:
 - list of datasets which have been skimmed and made into minitrees (configs/datsets.dat)
 - mass windows (in GeV) used for limit extraction at different WR mass hypotheses. These values are used by analysis.cpp.

\par Datasets
The datasets which have been processed into minitrees are listed in 
\verbatim
configs/datasets.dat
\endverbatim

\ref triggers List of triggers used to filter events at skim level

\section _UTILS Utilities
\par How to estimate cross sections
Once the dataset is entered in the datasets.dat config file putting dashes for cross section, cross section uncetainty, then you can use the script
\verbatim
 ./scripts/getXsec.sh
\endverbatim
to update the file with the estimated cross sections
Cross sections for SM processes can be found here:
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/StandardModelCrossSectionsat13TeV

Instructions on how to get the cross sections of a MC sample: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/HowToGenXSecAnalyzer

\section _ANALYSISSEQ Analysis sequence

\subsection _SKIMS Skims
Follow the link \ref skim_page
\note microAOD_cff

In order to make the skims:
\verbatim
scripts/crabSkimJobs/makeAndRunCrabSkimScripts.sh
\endverbatim
and then submit the relevant crab tasks

\verbatim
for skim in tmp/skim*.py; do crab submit -c $skim; done
\endverbatim


To update the list of datasets with the published skims:
\verbatim
scripts/crabSkimJobs/updateDatasetsWithSkims.sh
\endverbatim


\subsection MINITREE_ MiniTree production
The actual code to produce miniTree works only on LXPLUS at CERN on the batch system using CRAB2.

To load CRAB2 environment in bash:
\verbatim
source /afs/cern.ch/cms/LCG/LCG-2/UI/cms_ui_env.sh
cmsenv
source /afs/cern.ch/cms/ccs/wm/scripts/Crab/crab.sh
voms-proxy-init -voms cms -out $HOME/gpi.out
\endverbatim

If the USER is not Shervin, the SCHEDULER should be set to LSF like:
\verbatim
./script/makeLSFTTreeScripts.sh --scheduler=lsf
\endverbatim

To check the status of the jobs and merge the jobs:
\verbatim
./script/makeLSFTTreeScripts.sh --scheduler=lsf --check
\endverbatim

\b CAVEAT: the script is set to save the ntuples in Shervin's area on EOS. It has not been yet generalized. So it is not supposed to work for other users in other storage elements on-the-fly.
On can also use --scheduler=remoteGlidein to run over the GRID. The storage element is still CERN. LSF has not been tested. 


the cfg to be used is 
\verbatim 
test/runAnalysis_cfg.py
\endverbatim

There are three paths defined:
 - SignalRegion
 - FlavourSideband
 - LowDiLeptonSideband

A simple blinding filter is used if option isMC is set to 0 (so for data). This can be improved


\subsection _PRODVALIDATION Validation of the production
\ref VALIDATIONSCRIPTS_

\par Making data/MC comparison plots
To make the data/MC plots for the flavor and low dilepton mass
sidebands, first run the analysis code with only 1 toy. 
For flavor sideband:
Edit the analysis.cpp file for nToys=1 and channel=Selector::EMu. The script
will loop over all the datasets and produce root files called
selected_tree_*_flavoursideband2.root.
\verbatim
make;./bin/analysis
\endverbatim
These files are the input to the plotting script. To make the plots,
edit the plotting script so that the channel matches the one chosen in
the analysis script. Make channel = Selector::EMu
\verbatim
cd test
mkdir test/plots/Flavor
mkdir test/plots/EELowDilepton
mkdir test/plots/MuMuLowDilepton
root -b miniPlotter.C
\endverbatim

Repeat the previous steps with the different channel options(EE or MuMu).
