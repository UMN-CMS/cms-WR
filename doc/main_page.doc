\par Main configuration file
Trying to collect all possible configurable things in a configuration file in configs/.
The file is \b configs/2015-v1.conf

Currently the following informations are stored there:
 - json file
 - dataset file (configs/datsets.dat)

\par Datasets
The list of datasets is written in 
\verbatim
configs/datasets.dat
\endverbatim

\ref triggers List of triggers used to filter events at preselection level

\par How to estimate cross sections
Once the dataset is entered in the datasets.dat config file putting dashes for cross section, cross section uncetainty, then you can use the script
\verbatim
 ./scripts/getXsec.sh
\endverbatim
to update the file with the estimated cross sections

\par Skims
\ref skim_page
\note microAOD_cff

In order to make the skims:
\verbatim
scripts/crabSkimJobs/makeAndRunCrabSkimScripts.sh
\endverbatim
and then submit the relevant crab tasks

\verbatim
for skim in tmp/skim*.py; do crab submit -c $skim; done
\endverbatim


To update the list of datasets with the published skims:
\verbatim
scripts/crabSkimJobs/updateDatasetsWithSkims.sh
\endverbatim

\par JEC
The twiki page is:
\url https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/JECDataMC

74X_mcRun2_asymptotic_v4




\par Running the analysis
the cfg to be used is 
\verbatim 
test/runAnalysis_cfg.py
\endverbatim

There are three paths defined:
 - SignalRegion
 - FlavourSideband
 - LowDiLeptonSideband

A simple blinding filter is used if option isMC is set to 0 (so for data). This can be improved

\par selection ID scale factors
