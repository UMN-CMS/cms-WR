/**
\page _TTBARBKG Estimate of the TTbar background from data

To estimate ttBar in the EE and MuMu signal regions using real data, two scale factors must be computed using TTBar MC.  The two scale factors, EE/EMu and MuMu/EMu, represent
the ratios M_EEJJ/M_EMuJJ and M_MuMuJJ/M_EMuJJ taken from TTBar MC events which have passed all signal region selection cuts.  To calculate these ratios and save them
to a root file named flavor_fits.root, run these commands in cmsWR/.:

\verbatim
make
./bin/analysis -m TT -c MuMu >& ttMuMuSignalRegion.txt &
./bin/analysis -m TT -c EE >& ttEESignalRegion.txt &
./bin/analysis -m TT -c EMu >& ttEMuSignalRegion.txt &
cd test/
root -l -b runFlavorSideband.C
\endverbatim

the scale factors are determined by dividing two M_LLJJ histos (like M_EEJJ/M_EMuJJ), and fitting a linear function [0]*x + [1] to the resulting divided histogram.
The scale factor is the value [1] after the fit.  To extract these scale factors from the file flavor_fits.root, the file should be opened, and these commands should
be executed:

\verbatim f_EE->GetParameter(1)\endverbatim returns the EE/EMu scale factor
\verbatim f_EE->GetParError(1)\endverbatim  returns the error on the EE/EMu scale factor
analogous calls to obtain the MuMu/EMu scale factor.

The EE/EMu scale factor should be between 0.4 and 0.5, and the MuMu/EMu scale factor should be between 0.5 and 0.65.
