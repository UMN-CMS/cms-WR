/**
\page _TTBARBKG Estimate of the TTbar background from data

To estimate ttBar in the EE and MuMu signal regions using real data, two scale factors must be computed using TTBar MC.  The two scale factors, EE/EMu and MuMu/EMu, represent
the ratios M_EEJJ/M_EMuJJ and M_MuMuJJ/M_EMuJJ taken from TTBar MC events which have passed all signal region selection cuts.  To calculate these ratios and save them
to a root file named flavor_fits.root, run these commands in cmsWR/.: (--cut_channel has no effect on the results relevant to this section)

\verbatim
voms-proxy-init --voms cms
make
./bin/analysis -m TT -c MuMu >& ttMuMuSignalRegion.txt &
./bin/analysis -m TT -c EE >& ttEESignalRegion.txt &
./bin/analysis -m TT -c EMu --cut_channel EE >& ttEMuSignalRegion.txt &
./bin/analysis -m data -c EMu --cut_channel EE >& dataEMuSignalRegion.txt &
cd test/
in flavorSideband.C, make sure the four h_WR_mass TH1F pointers whose max domain is 6000 and have variable bin widths
are the only TH1F pointers which are uncommented.
root -l -b
.L flavorSideband.C+
flavorSideband()
.q
\endverbatim

The scale factors will be printed to stdout and written to a file in data/2015-v1/.  Rescale the EMu collision data by one
scale factor to obtain the ttbar estimate in one channel.
