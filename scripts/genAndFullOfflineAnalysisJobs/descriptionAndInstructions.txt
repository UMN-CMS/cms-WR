this collection of code is used to generate WR->ENu->EEQQ events at GEN level, and subject the generated events to
a sequence of cuts which are representative of the RECO level eejj signal region (M_LL>200, M_LLJJ>600) cuts.  Running
this code will create two sets of output files: one set of GEN events in .root files, and one set of TTrees in .root
files representing the GEN events which have been subjected to the offline cuts.  This code collection is designed
to run on the FNAL LPC cluster with condor, and store the two sets of output files in FNAL /eos/uscms/store/user
space.

This code will generate a fixed number of GEN events at many points in a 2D (MWR, MNu) space.  The number of events
generated at each point, the distance (in GeV) between neighboring points in the MWR or MNu directions, the minimum
MNu and maximum MWR values, path names to the directories which will store the output TTree and GEN event files, and
the absolute path name of the directory which contains the job run .csh scripts are all defined in
makeGenRunOfflineAnalysisScripts.sh.  The generation can be switched to muon flavor from electron flavor by changing
the following line in WR_M-UNDEF_ToLNu_M-UNDEF_GEN.py

            '9900024:onIfAny = 11 9900012'
to
            '9900024:onIfAny = 13 9900014'

the offline cuts will require the electrons and muons to have |eta| < 2.4 , but the effect of this on the events
passing the full selection will be negligible.  The entire generation and offline selection sequence will work as
it should whether the WR decay products are electrons or muons.

To run this code in your own area you must update several parameters in the makeGenRunOfflineAnalysisScripts.sh file.
The absolute path names to the output TTree, GEN event, and input job .csh scripts directories must be changed.
In makeGen...sh the parameter named 'increment' controls the distance between
neighboring points in the (MWR, MNu) plane.  50 (GeV) is the default spacing.  The other numerical parameters control
the min MNu value, the min and max MWR value, and the number of events to generate at each (MWR, MNu) point.  Once these
parameters are updated you can execute the makeGenRunOfflineAnalysisScripts.sh script, and submitGenAndOfflineAnalysisJobs.sh
to start the simulations.


Once the GEN jobs finish, the macro calculateGenWrScaleFactors.C can be used.  This macro calculates the efficiency ratio
as a function of MNu and MWR, saves this information to a txt file, and plots the same information in a 2D color plot.
Once the jobs finish, this macro can be executed by calling

root -l calculateGenWrScaleFactors.C

the name of the txt file and 2D plot created by this macro can be modified within the macro.
